# renewable-energy-react-native

## Techs: TypeScript, React-Native, Styled-Components + Atomic Design.

### This was made in between my daily tasks, and I did the best I could for the moment.

### As I mentioned to the recruiter, I could not afford to stop 2 full days to do the test.

### As I work + freelance to keep up with the bills, this is the best I can do without sacrificing too much of revenue to deliver a test that, let's face it, could go sideways.

### It has 3 bugs that I can see, no validations on fields and no Redux.

### If I had more time to spare, none of those would be in the project and Redux would be implemented. At least ContextAPI.

### I used 3 approaches to CSS: Styled-Components, inline styles and StyleSheet styles. In order to show that I know how to use them.

### I hope you find this test interesting. Let me know if you have some feedback. It would be very much appreciated.
